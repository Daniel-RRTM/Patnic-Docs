### Modules
My Project structure follows an Systemic design pilosophy, its goal is toappend new themes of Features as an Module-folder,which acts like a Blackbox. The only Accespoint is their SIngleton API which saniticies, validates or logs if neccessary.

Here are the conversioned Namespaces and their Usage:  
|Namespace                   | Usage                                                                            |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| > API                      |  proxy functions with Saniticer,Validator and/or Logger                          |
